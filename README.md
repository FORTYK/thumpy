# thumpy

Thumpy is a small python-script that listens to a folder and generates thumbnails based on images that are put into an observed folder. Thumby is meant to run as a background process.

Thumby was created on a whim when I was attempting to reduce a website's load times, which is why Thumpy is dumpy.

As of now Thumpy does not allow any configuration without modifying source code.
