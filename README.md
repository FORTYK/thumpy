# thumpy

thumpy is a small python-script that generates thumbnails based on images that are put into an observed folder. thumpy is meant to run as a background process.

This script was created on a whim when I was attempting to reduce a website's load times.

As of now Thumpy does not allow any configuration without modifying source code.

Dependencies:
* Pillow (8.1.2)
* Watchdog (2.0.2)
